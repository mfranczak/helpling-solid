=================================

# Violations
* Provides an implementation for all the methods of the base class.
* Returns the type of things the base class prescribes.
* Doesn’t put extra constraints on arguments for methods.
* Doesn’t make use of non-strict typing to break the contract that was provided by the base class.

# TODO
* Generate jobs for DEO200 and list them. What is wrong with the application? Investigate the problem.
